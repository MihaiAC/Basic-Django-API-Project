# Basic-Django-API-Project

Basic Django REST API. The aim of the project was to familiarise myself with DRF and get more experience with Docker.

Features:
- authentication using JWT;
- (loosely) used TDD when writing the endpoint tests;
- CI with GitHub actions;
- Dockerized environment;
- uWSGI and Nginx for deployment;
  
Project based on this [course](https://www.udemy.com/course/django-python-advanced/).
